# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

### You will need to install:
- `node.js` to install and deal with a server side.
- `express`, `body-parser` and `cors` in your machine.
- Create `API credentials` on `OpenWeatherMap.com`.
  
## How the app work
- Enter a valid `ZipCode` in the corresponds field.
- Type in How do you feel in the corresponds field.
- Click on the `Genetate` button to get the `Temperature` of that city along with your `Feeling` and the `Date` of the day.

## Extras
I hope you like it :)
